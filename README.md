# Auto delete

Auto delete is a simple React.js application that allows you to manage a list of products by categorizing them into "Fruits" and "Vegetables." You can also see the selected product name in an input field before adding it to a category. Products are automatically removed from categories after 5 seconds if not removed manually.
